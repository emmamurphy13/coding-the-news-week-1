*WRITTEN BY AI*

I’m thrilled to be entering my second semester at the **Newmark Graduate School of Journalism**! This semester I'm eager to deepen my reporting skills, explore new storytelling formats, and collaborate with peers and mentors across the program. I’m energized by the opportunity to tackle challenging projects and contribute to impactful journalism.

*ME*
I asked AI to write me something about, "how excited I am to be in my second semester at Newmark Graduate School of Journalism" and the paragraph above is what it came up with. While I don't think it's awful it doesn't sound like me at all so I would need to edit the text a lot.
